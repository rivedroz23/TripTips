# What is TripTips?
TripTips is a travel related app that allows you to check out the city that you are in (the app only covers 2 cities for now..) and see all the best places in town that other tourists have posted about! The app makes it a lot faster to find cool places to visit than searching Google or Yelp would be! No sponsored or random results.
